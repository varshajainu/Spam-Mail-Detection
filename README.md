ABSTRACT
SMS (Short Message Service) is still the primary choice as a communication medium even though nowadays
mobile phone is growing with a variety of communication media messenger applications. However,
nowadays along with the SMS tariff reduction leads to the increase of SMS spam, as used by some people as
an alternative to advertise and fraud. Therefore, it becomes an important issue as it can bug and harm the
users and one of its solutions is with automatic SMS spam filtering.
One of most challenging in SMS spam filtering is its accuracy. In this research we proposed to
enhance SMS spam filtering performance by combining two of data mining task association and
classification. FP-growth in association is utilized for mining frequent pattern on SMS and Naive Bayes
Classifier is used to classify whether SMS is spam or ham. Training data was using SMS spam collection
from previous research. The result of using collaboration of Naive Bayes and FP-Growth performs the
highest average accuracy of 90%. FP-Growth for dataset SMS Spam Collection and improves the precision
score; thus, the classification result is more accurate.
